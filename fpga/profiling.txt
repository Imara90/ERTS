 When profiling without any interrupts all in us

time to get a character: 14
time to decode: 171
time to check sum: 97
time to store data: 827
MAX time to store data: 2750
time to send telemetry: 620
MAX time to send telemetry: 3574
time to check commflag: 16

time to switch case SAFE_MODE: 277
time to switch case MANUAL_MODE: 187
time to switch case CALIBRATION_MODE: 199
time to switch case YAW_CONTROL_MODE: 346
time to switch case FULL_CONTROL_MODE: 606

isr_rs232_rx: 49
isr_rs232_tx: 60/17

Improvements possible:

- storing data
- send telemetry
- checksum
- full control mode

Printing with sum improvement was initially done to pretify the code, however when running the
the circular.c code I wrote that for writing 10 elements:
time to print without sum: 202 
time to print no sum: 282 

So I will optimize to write to the buffer without adding the sum, the number of elements in the buffer is 
is 32, so that should save 3 * 80 us = 240 us. The calculation of the sum should be less then.
Time to compute the sum now is 123, so that saves is 240 - 123 us = 117 us. 

We can also do this with the sending of the telemetry

    New times:

time to store data: 607
time to send telemetry: 565

cbGet, for 30 characters now takes 528 us
when inlining the decode function, it has a slight speedup of 21us:

time to decode: 150

Writing in a for loop takes much longer for example writing 10 elements to a buffer takes 203 us, 
but outside the for loop it takes 127 us. So we are doing that for the checksum. This provides
a speedup of 54 us.

Time to check sum: 43 us.
if we further inline this, it takes 37us

Time to check sum: 37us.

when inlining and extracting the for loop of safemode we can increase the speed pf the safe mode
with a speedup of 104us

Time to switch case SAFE_MODE: 173

toggleing a led

0x0041				65 us

When inlining the butt2filter, the full control mode is reduced to 579 us.
